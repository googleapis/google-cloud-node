   *  * `returnScore`: Boolean. If set to true, the recommendation score
   *     corresponding to each returned Document is set in
   *     RecommendResponse.RecommendationResult.metadata google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.RecommendResponse.RecommendationResult.metadata.
   *     The given score indicates the probability of a Document conversion given
   *     the user's context and history.
   *  * `strictFiltering`: Boolean. True by default. If set to `false`, the
   *  service
   *     returns generic (unfiltered) popular Documents instead of empty if
   *     your filter blocks all recommendation results.
   *  * `diversityLevel`: String. Default empty. If set to be non-empty, then
   *     it needs to be one of:
   *      *  `no-diversity`
   *      *  `low-diversity`
   *      *  `medium-diversity`
   *      *  `high-diversity`
   *      *  `auto-diversity`

   *     based on Document category.
