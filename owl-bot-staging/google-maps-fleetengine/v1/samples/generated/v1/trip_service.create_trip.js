   *  The following fields are used if you provide them:
   *  * `number_of_passengers`

   *  * `intermediate_destinations`
   *  * `vehicle_waypoints`

   *  `trip_status` of `NEW` even if you pass in a `trip_status` of `CANCELED` in
   *  the creation request.
   *  Only `EXCLUSIVE` trips support `intermediate_destinations`.
   *  When `vehicle_id` is set for a shared trip, you must supply
   *  the list of `Trip.vehicle_waypoints` to specify the order of the remaining
   *  waypoints for the vehicle, otherwise the waypoint order will be
   *  undetermined.
   *  When you specify `Trip.vehicle_waypoints`, the list must contain all
   *  the remaining waypoints of the vehicle's trips, with no extra waypoints.
   *  You must order these waypoints such that for a given trip, the pickup
   *  point is before intermediate destinations, and all intermediate
   *  destinations come before the drop-off point. An `EXCLUSIVE` trip's
   *  waypoints must not interleave with any other trips.
   *  The `trip_id`, `waypoint_type` and `location` fields are used, and all
   *  other TripWaypoint fields in `vehicle_waypoints` are ignored.
