   *  request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that for at
   *  least 60 minutes since the first request.
   *  For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
   *  the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request
   *  ID, the server can check if the original operation with the same request ID
   *  was received, and if so, ignores the second request. This prevents
   *  clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.
