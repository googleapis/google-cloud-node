   *  Expression that defines the filter to apply across findings.
   *  The expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical

   *  Parentheses are not supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`.
   *  Restrictions have the form `<field> <operator> <value>` and may have a `-`
   *  character in front of them to indicate negation. Examples include:
   *   * name
   *   * source_properties.a_property
   *   * security_marks.marks.marka
   *  The supported operators are:
   *  * `=` for all value types.
   *  * `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for integer values.
   *  * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.
   *  The supported value types are:
   *  * string literals in quotes.
   *  * integer literals without quotes.
   *  * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes.
   *  For example, `source_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string.
