   *  Expression that defines the filter to apply across assets.
   *  The expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via logical
   *  operators `AND` and `OR`.
   *  Parentheses are not supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`.
   *  Restrictions have the form `<field> <operator> <value>` and may have a `-`
   *  character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields map to those
   *  defined in the Asset resource. Examples include:
   *  * name
   *  * security_center_properties.resource_name
   *  * resource_properties.a_property
   *  * security_marks.marks.marka
   *  The supported operators are:
   *  * `=` for all value types.
   *  * `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for integer values.
   *  * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.
   *  The supported value types are:
   *  * string literals in quotes.
   *  * integer literals without quotes.
   *  * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes.
   *  For example, `resource_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string.

   *  removed and re-created again.

   *  * "ACTIVE": indicates that the asset was present at both the
   *               start and the end of the time period defined by
