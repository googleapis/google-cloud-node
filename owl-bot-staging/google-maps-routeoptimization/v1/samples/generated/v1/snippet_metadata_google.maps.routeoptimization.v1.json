      "description": " Sends an `OptimizeToursRequest` containing a `ShipmentModel` and returns an `OptimizeToursResponse` containing `ShipmentRoute`s, which are a set of routes to be performed by vehicles minimizing the overall cost. A `ShipmentModel` model consists mainly of `Shipment`s that need to be carried out and `Vehicle`s that can be used to transport the `Shipment`s. The `ShipmentRoute`s assign `Shipment`s to `Vehicle`s. More specifically, they assign a series of `Visit`s to each vehicle, where a `Visit` corresponds to a `VisitRequest`, which is a pickup or delivery for a `Shipment`. The goal is to provide an assignment of `ShipmentRoute`s to `Vehicle`s that minimizes the total cost where cost has many components defined in the `ShipmentModel`.",

      "description": " Optimizes vehicle tours for one or more `OptimizeToursRequest` messages as a batch. This method is a Long Running Operation (LRO). The inputs for optimization (`OptimizeToursRequest` messages) and outputs (`OptimizeToursResponse` messages) are read from and written to Cloud Storage in user-specified format. Like the `OptimizeTours` method, each `OptimizeToursRequest` contains a `ShipmentModel` and returns an `OptimizeToursResponse` containing `ShipmentRoute` fields, which are a set of routes to be performed by vehicles minimizing the overall cost. The user can poll `operations.get` to check the status of the LRO: If the LRO `done` field is false, then at least one request is still being processed. Other requests may have completed successfully and their results are available in Cloud Storage. If the LRO's `done` field is true, then all requests have been processed. Any successfully processed requests will have their results available in Cloud Storage. Any requests that failed will not have their results available in Cloud Storage. If the LRO's `error` field is set, then it contains the error from one of the failed requests.",
