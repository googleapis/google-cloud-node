   *  Optional. A string which identifies an Autocomplete session for billing
   *  purposes. Must be a URL and filename safe base64 string with at most 36
   *  ASCII characters in length. Otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is
   *  returned.
   *  The session begins when the user starts typing a query, and concludes when
   *  they select a place and a call to Place Details or Address Validation is
   *  made. Each session can have multiple queries, followed by one Place Details
   *  or Address Validation request. The credentials used for each request within
   *  a session must belong to the same Google Cloud Console project. Once a
   *  session has concluded, the token is no longer valid; your app must generate
   *  a fresh token for each session. If the `session_token` parameter is
   *  omitted, or if you reuse a session token, the session is charged as if no
   *  session token was provided (each request is billed separately).
   *  We recommend the following guidelines:
   *  * Use session tokens for all Place Autocomplete calls.
   *  * Generate a fresh token for each session. Using a version 4 UUID is
   *    recommended.
   *  * Ensure that the credentials used for all Place Autocomplete, Place
   *    Details, and Address Validation requests within a session belong to the
   *    same Cloud Console project.
   *  * Be sure to pass a unique session token for each new session. Using the
   *    same token for more than one session will result in each request being
   *    billed individually.
