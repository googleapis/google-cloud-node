   *  The session begins when the user starts typing a query, and concludes when
   *  they select a place and a call to Place Details or Address Validation is

   *  or Address Validation request. The credentials used for each request within

   *  session token was provided (each request is billed separately).
   *  We recommend the following guidelines:
   *  * Use session tokens for all Place Autocomplete calls.
   *  * Generate a fresh token for each session. Using a version 4 UUID is
   *    recommended.
   *  * Ensure that the credentials used for all Place Autocomplete, Place
   *    Details, and Address Validation requests within a session belong to the
   *    same Cloud Console project.
   *  * Be sure to pass a unique session token for each new session. Using the
   *    same token for more than one session will result in each request being
   *    billed individually.
