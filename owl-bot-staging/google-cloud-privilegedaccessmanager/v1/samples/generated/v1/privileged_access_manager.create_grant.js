   *  ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees
   *  this for at least 60 minutes after the first request.
   *  For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the
   *  request times out. If you make the request again with the same request
   *  ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID
   *  was received, and if so, ignores the second request. This prevents
   *  clients from accidentally creating duplicate grants.
   *  The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is
   *  not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
