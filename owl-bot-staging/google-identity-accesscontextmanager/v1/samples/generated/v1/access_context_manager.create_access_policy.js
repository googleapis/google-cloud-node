   *  The scopes of a policy define which resources an ACM policy can restrict,

   *  - vpcsc perimeters can only restrict projects within folders/123
   *  - access levels can only be referenced by resources within folders/123.

   *  referenced.
   *  Only one policy can include a given scope (attempting to create a second
   *  policy which includes "folders/123" will result in an error).
   *  Currently, scopes cannot be modified after a policy is created.
