  /**
   *  Optional. A query filter.
   *  You can filter messages by date (`create_time`) and thread (`thread.name`).
   *  To filter messages by the date they were created, specify the `create_time`
   *  with a timestamp in RFC-3339 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339)
   *  format and double quotation marks. For example,
   *  `"2023-04-21T11:30:00-04:00"`. You can use the greater than operator `>` to
   *  list messages that were created after a timestamp, or the less than
   *  operator `<` to list messages that were created before a timestamp. To
   *  filter messages within a time interval, use the `AND` operator between two
   *  timestamps.
   *  To filter by thread, specify the `thread.name`, formatted as
   *  `spaces/{space}/threads/{thread}`. You can only specify one
   *  `thread.name` per query.
   *  To filter by both thread and date, use the `AND` operator in your query.
   *  For example, the following queries are valid:
   *  ```
   *  create_time > "2012-04-21T11:30:00-04:00"
   *  create_time > "2012-04-21T11:30:00-04:00" AND
   *    thread.name = spaces/AAAAAAAAAAA/threads/123
   *  create_time > "2012-04-21T11:30:00+00:00" AND
   *  create_time < "2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00" AND
   *    thread.name = spaces/AAAAAAAAAAA/threads/123
   *  thread.name = spaces/AAAAAAAAAAA/threads/123
   *  ```
   *  Invalid queries are rejected by the server with an `INVALID_ARGUMENT`
   *  error.
