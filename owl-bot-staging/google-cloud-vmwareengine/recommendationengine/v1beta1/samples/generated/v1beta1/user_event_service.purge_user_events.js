   *  Required. The filter string to specify the events to be deleted. Empty

   *  ListUserEvents API to list events that will be deleted. The eligible fields
   *  for filtering are:
   *  * eventType - UserEvent.eventType field of type string.
   *  * eventTime - in ISO 8601 "zulu" format.
   *  * visitorId - field of type string. Specifying this will delete all events
   *  associated with a visitor.
   *  * userId - field of type string. Specifying this will delete all events
   *  associated with a user.
   *  Example 1: Deleting all events in a time range.
   *  `eventTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventTime <
   *  "2012-04-23T18:30:43.511Z"`
   *  Example 2: Deleting specific eventType in time range.
   *  `eventTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventType = "detail-page-view"`
   *  Example 3: Deleting all events for a specific visitor
   *  `visitorId = visitor1024`
   *  The filtering fields are assumed to have an implicit AND.
