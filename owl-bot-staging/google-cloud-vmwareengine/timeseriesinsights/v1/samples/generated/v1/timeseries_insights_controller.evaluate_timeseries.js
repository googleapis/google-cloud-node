   *  Evaluate this time series without requiring it was previously loaded in

   *  evaluateSlice or query with
   *  detectionTime google.cloud.timeseriesinsights.v1.EvaluateSliceRequest.detection_time  set to
   *  `timeseries.point(timeseries.point_size() - 1).time`.
   *  The length of the time series must be at least 10.
   *  All points must have the same time offset relative to the granularity. For
   *  example, if the granularity google.cloud.timeseriesinsights.v1.EvaluateTimeseriesRequest.granularity  is "5s", then the following
   *  point.time sequences are valid:
   *  - "100s", "105s", "120s", "125s" (no offset)
   *  - "102s", "107s", "122s", "127s" (offset is "2s")
   *  However, the following sequence is invalid as it has inconsistent offsets:
   *  - "100s", "105s", "122s", "127s" (offsets are either "0s" or "2s")
