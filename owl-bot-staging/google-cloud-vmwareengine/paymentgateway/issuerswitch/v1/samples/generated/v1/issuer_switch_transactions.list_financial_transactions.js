   *  An expression that filters the list of financial transactions.
   *  A filter expression consists of a field name, a comparison operator, and
   *  a value for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a
   *  boolean. The comparison operator must be one of: `<`, `>`, or `=`.
   *  Filters are not case sensitive.
   *  The following fields in the `FinancialTransaction` are eligible for
   *  filtering:
   *    * `transactionType` - The transaction type of the financial
   *    transaction. Must be one of TransactionType google.cloud.paymentgateway.issuerswitch.v1.TransactionType  values. For financial
   *    transactions, only valid transaction types are `TRANSACTION_TYPE_CREDIT`,
   *    `TRANSACTION_TYPE_DEBIT` and `TRANSACTION_TYPE_REVERSAL`. Allowed
   *    comparison operators: `=`.
   *    * `transactionID` - The UPI transaction ID of the financial
   *    transaction. Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *    * `RRN` - The retrieval reference number of the transaction. Allowed
   *    comparison operators: `=`.
   *    * `payerVPA` - The VPA of the payer in a financial transaction. Allowed
   *    comparison operators: `=`.
   *    * `payeeVPA` - The VPA of the payee in a financial transaction. Allowed
   *    comparison operators: `=`.
   *    * `payerMobileNumber` - The mobile number of the payer in a financial
   *       transaction. Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *    * `payeeMobileNumber` - The mobile number of the payee in a financial
   *       transaction. Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *    * `payeeMerchantId` - The merchant id of the payee in a financial
   *       transaction. Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *    * `createTime` - The time at which the transaction was created
   *    (received) by the issuer switch. The value should be in
   *    the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`. Allowed comparison operators: `>`,
   *    `<`.
   *    * `state` - The state of the transaction. Must be one of
   *    TransactionInfo.State google.cloud.paymentgateway.issuerswitch.v1.TransactionInfo.State  values. Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *    * `errorCode` - Use this filter to list financial transactions which
   *    have failed a particular error code. Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *    * `bankAdapterRequestID` - Request ID used when invoking the Bank
   *    Adapter API for fulfilling a transaction request. Allowed comparison
   *    operators: `=`.
   *  You can combine multiple expressions by enclosing each expression in
   *  parentheses. Expressions are combined with AND logic. No other logical
   *  operators are supported.
   *  Here are a few examples:
   *    * `transactionType = CREDIT` - The transaction type is _CREDIT_.
   *    * `state = SUCCEEDED` - The transaction's state is _SUCCEEDED_.
   *    * `payerVpa = example@okbank` - The VPA of the payer is the string
   *    _example@okbank_.
   *    * `(transactionType = DEBIT) AND (createTime < "2021-08-15T14:50:00Z")`
   *    - The transaction type is _DEBIT_ and the transaction was received
   *    before _2021-08-15 14:50:00 UTC_.
   *    * `createTime > "2021-08-15T14:50:00Z" AND createTime <
   *    "2021-08-16T14:50:00Z"` - The transaction was received between
   *    _2021-08-15 14:50:00 UTC_ and _2021-08-16 14:50:00 UTC_.
