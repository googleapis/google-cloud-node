   *  request doesn't result in creation of duplicate commitments for at least 60

   *  For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the
   *  request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID,
   *  the server can check if the original operation with the same request ID was
   *  received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients
   *  from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.
   *  The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is
   *  not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
