  /**
   *  Optional. The filter to list results by.
   *  General `filter` string syntax:
   *  `<field> <operator> <value> (<logical connector>)`
   *  *   `<field>` can be `name`, `address`, `port`, or `metadata.<key>` for map
   *      field
   *  *   `<operator>` can be `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=`, `=`, `:`. Of which `:`
   *      means `HAS`, and is roughly the same as `=`
   *  *   `<value>` must be the same data type as field
   *  *   `<logical connector>` can be `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
   *  Examples of valid filters:
   *  *   `metadata.owner` returns endpoints that have a metadata with the key
   *      `owner`, this is the same as `metadata:owner`
   *  *   `metadata.protocol=gRPC` returns endpoints that have key/value
   *      `protocol=gRPC`
   *  *   `address=192.108.1.105` returns endpoints that have this address
   *  *   `port>8080` returns endpoints that have port number larger than 8080
   *  *
   *  `name>projects/my-project/locations/us-east1/namespaces/my-namespace/services/my-service/endpoints/endpoint-c`
   *      returns endpoints that have name that is alphabetically later than the
   *      string, so "endpoint-e" is returned but "endpoint-a" is not
   *  *   `metadata.owner!=sd AND metadata.foo=bar` returns endpoints that have
   *      `owner` in metadata key but value is not `sd` AND have key/value
   *       `foo=bar`
   *  *   `doesnotexist.foo=bar` returns an empty list. Note that endpoint
   *      doesn't have a field called "doesnotexist". Since the filter does not
   *      match any endpoints, it returns no results
   *  For more information about filtering, see
   *  API Filtering (https://aip.dev/160).
   */
  // const filter = 'abc123'
  /**
   *  Optional. The order to list results by.
   *  General `order_by` string syntax: `<field> (<asc|desc>) (,)`
   *  *   `<field>` allows values: `name`, `address`, `port`
   *  *   `<asc|desc>` ascending or descending order by `<field>`. If this is
   *      left blank, `asc` is used
   *  Note that an empty `order_by` string results in default order, which is
   *  order by `name` in ascending order.
