   *  returned.
   *  The session begins when the user starts typing a query, and concludes when
   *  they select a place and a call to Place Details or Address Validation is
   *  made. Each session can have multiple autocomplete queries, followed by one
   *  Place Details or Address Validation request. The credentials used for each

   *  parameter is omitted, or if you reuse a session token, the session is
   *  charged as if no session token was provided (each request is billed
