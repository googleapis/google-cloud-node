These keys can be open or closed, indicating if the range includes rows with that key.</p><p>Keys are represented by lists, where the ith value in the list corresponds to the ith component of the table or index primary key. Individual values are encoded as described {@link here}.</p><p>For example, consider the following table definition:</p><pre><code>CREATE TABLE UserEvents ( UserName STRING(MAX), EventDate STRING(10) ) PRIMARY KEY(UserName, EventDate); </code></pre><p>The following keys name rows in this table:</p><pre><code>[&quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;2014-09-23&quot;] [&quot;Alfred&quot;, &quot;2015-06-12&quot;] </code></pre><p>Since the <code>UserEvents</code> table&#39;s <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> clause names two columns, each <code>UserEvents</code> key has two elements; the first is the <code>UserName</code>, and the second is the <code>EventDate</code>.</p><p>Key ranges with multiple components are interpreted lexicographically by component using the table or index key&#39;s declared sort order. For example, the following range returns all events for user <code>&quot;Bob&quot;</code> that occurred in the year 2015:</p><pre><code>&quot;start_closed&quot;: [&quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;2015-01-01&quot;] &quot;end_closed&quot;: [&quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;2015-12-31&quot;] </code></pre><p>Start and end keys can omit trailing key components. This affects the inclusion and exclusion of rows that exactly match the provided key components: if the key is closed, then rows that exactly match the provided components are included; if the key is open, then rows that exactly match are not included.</p><p>For example, the following range includes all events for <code>&quot;Bob&quot;</code> that occurred during and after the year 2000:</p><pre><code>&quot;start_closed&quot;: [&quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;2000-01-01&quot;] &quot;end_closed&quot;: [&quot;Bob&quot;] </code></pre><p>The next example retrieves all events for <code>&quot;Bob&quot;</code>:</p><pre><code>&quot;start_closed&quot;: [&quot;Bob&quot;] &quot;end_closed&quot;: [&quot;Bob&quot;] </code></pre><p>To retrieve events before the year 2000:</p><pre><code>&quot;start_closed&quot;: [&quot;Bob&quot;] &quot;end_open&quot;: [&quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;2000-01-01&quot;] </code></pre><p>The following range includes all rows in the table:</p><pre><code>&quot;start_closed&quot;: [] &quot;end_closed&quot;: [] </code></pre><p>This range returns all users whose <code>UserName</code> begins with any character from A to C:</p><pre><code>&quot;start_closed&quot;: [&quot;A&quot;] &quot;end_open&quot;: [&quot;D&quot;] </code></pre><p>This range returns all users whose <code>UserName</code> begins with B:</p><pre><code>&quot;start_closed&quot;: [&quot;B&quot;] &quot;end_open&quot;: [&quot;C&quot;] </code></pre><p>Key ranges honor column sort order.
