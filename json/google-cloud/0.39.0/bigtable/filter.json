For example, a row filter might trim down a row to include just the cells from columns matching a given regular expression, or might return all the cells of a row but not their values. More complicated filters can be composed out of these components to express requests such as, &quot;within every column of a particular family, give just the two most recent cells which are older than timestamp X.&quot;</p><p>There are two broad categories of filters (true filters and transformers), as well as two ways to compose simple filters into more complex ones (<a data-custom-type=\"bigtable/filter\" data-method=\"interleave\">bigtable/filter#interleave</a>). They work as follows:</p><p>True filters alter the input row by excluding some of its cells wholesale from the output row. An example of a true filter is the <a data-custom-type=\"bigtable/filter\" data-method=\"value\">bigtable/filter#value</a> filter, which excludes cells whose values don&#39;t match the specified pattern. All regex true filters use RE2 syntax (<a href=\"https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax\">https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax</a>) and are evaluated as full matches. An important point to keep in mind is that RE2(.) is equivalent by default to RE2([^\\n]), meaning that it does not match newlines. When attempting to match an arbitrary byte, you should therefore use the escape sequence &#39;\\C&#39;, which may need to be further escaped as &#39;\\C&#39; in your client language.</p><p>Transformers alter the input row by changing the values of some of its cells in the output, without excluding them completely. Currently, the only supported transformer is the <a data-custom-type=\"bigtable/filter\" data-method=\"value\">bigtable/filter#value</a> <code>strip</code> filter, which replaces every cell&#39;s value with the empty string.</p><p>The total serialized size of a filter message must not exceed 4096 bytes, and filters may not be nested within each other to a depth of more than 20.</p><p>Use the following table for the various examples found throughout the filter documentation.</p><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Row Key</th> <th style=\"text-align:center\">follows:gwashington</th> <th style=\"text-align:center\">follows:jadams</th> <th style=\"text-align:center\">follows:tjefferson</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>gwashington</td> <td style=\"text-align:center\"></td> <td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td> <td style=\"text-align:center\"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>tjefferson</td> <td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td> <td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td> <td style=\"text-align:center\"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>jadams</td> <td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td> <td style=\"text-align:center\"></td> <td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> ","source":"packages/bigtable/src/filter.js#L86","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[],"exceptions":[],"returns":[]},{"id":"all","name":"all","type":"instance","description":"","source":"packages/bigtable/src/filter.js#L246","resources":[],"examples":[{"caption":"<p>Matches all cells, regardless of input.
