/**
 * A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented
 * as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond
 * resolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts like "day"
 * or "month". It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between
 * two Timestamp values is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted
 * from a Timestamp. Range is approximately +-10,000 years.
 *
 * # Examples
 *
 * Example 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.
 *
 *     Timestamp start = ...;
 *     Timestamp end = ...;
 *     Duration duration = ...;
 *
 *     duration.seconds = end.seconds - start.seconds;
 *     duration.nanos = end.nanos - start.nanos;
 *
 *     if (duration.seconds < 0 && duration.nanos > 0) {
 *       duration.seconds += 1;
 *       duration.nanos -= 1000000000;
 *     } else if (durations.seconds > 0 && duration.nanos < 0) {
 *       duration.seconds -= 1;
 *       duration.nanos += 1000000000;
 *     }
 *
 * Example 2: Compute Timestamp from Timestamp + Duration in pseudo code.
 *
 *     Timestamp start = ...;
 *     Duration duration = ...;
 *     Timestamp end = ...;
 *
 *     end.seconds = start.seconds + duration.seconds;
 *     end.nanos = start.nanos + duration.nanos;
 *
 *     if (end.nanos < 0) {
 *       end.seconds -= 1;
 *       end.nanos += 1000000000;
 *     } else if (end.nanos >= 1000000000) {
 *       end.seconds += 1;
 *       end.nanos -= 1000000000;
 *     }
 *
 * Example 3: Compute Duration from datetime.timedelta in Python.
 *
 *     td = datetime.timedelta(days=3, minutes=10)
 *     duration = Duration()
 *     duration.FromTimedelta(td)
 *
 * # JSON Mapping
 *
 * In JSON format, the Duration type is encoded as a string rather than an
 * object, where the string ends in the suffix "s" (indicating seconds) and
 * is preceded by the number of seconds, with nanoseconds expressed as
 * fractional seconds. For example, 3 seconds with 0 nanoseconds should be
 * encoded in JSON format as "3s", while 3 seconds and 1 nanosecond should
 * be expressed in JSON format as "3.000000001s", and 3 seconds and 1
 * microsecond should be expressed in JSON format as "3.000001s".
 *
 * @property {number} seconds
 *   Signed seconds of the span of time. Must be from -315,576,000,000
 *   to +315,576,000,000 inclusive. Note: these bounds are computed from:
 *   60 sec/min * 60 min/hr * 24 hr/day * 365.25 days/year * 10000 years
 *
 * @property {number} nanos
 *   Signed fractions of a second at nanosecond resolution of the span
 *   of time. Durations less than one second are represented with a 0
 *   `seconds` field and a positive or negative `nanos` field. For durations
 *   of one second or more, a non-zero value for the `nanos` field must be
 *   of the same sign as the `seconds` field. Must be from -999,999,999
 *   to +999,999,999 inclusive.
