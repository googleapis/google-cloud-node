   *  A filter expression that matches resources returned in the response.
   *  The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the
   *  value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
   *  number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be `=`, `!=`, `>`, or
   *  `<`.
   *  For example, if you are filtering a list of private clouds, you can exclude
   *  the ones named `example-pc` by specifying `name != "example-pc"`.
   *  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
   *  `networkConfig.managementCidr = "192.168.0.0/24"` to include private clouds
   *  only if they have a matching address in their network configuration.
   *  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
   *  parentheses. For example:
   *  ```
   *  (name = "example-pc")
   *  (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z")
   *  ```
   *  By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
   *  include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example:
   *  ```
   *  (name = "private-cloud-1") AND
   *  (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z") OR
   *  (name = "private-cloud-2")

   *  Currently, only ordering by `name` is supported.
