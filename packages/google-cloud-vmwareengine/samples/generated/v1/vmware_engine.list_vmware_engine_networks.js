   *  A filter expression that matches resources returned in the response.
   *  The expression must specify the field name, a comparison
   *  operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
   *  must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator
   *  must be `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.
   *  For example, if you are filtering a list of network peerings, you can
   *  exclude the ones named `example-network` by specifying
   *  `name != "example-network"`.
   *  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
   *  parentheses. For example:
   *  ```
   *  (name = "example-network")
   *  (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z")
   *  ```
   *  By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
   *  can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
   *  For example:
   *  ```
   *  (name = "example-network-1") AND
   *  (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z") OR
