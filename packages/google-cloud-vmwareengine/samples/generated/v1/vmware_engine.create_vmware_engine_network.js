   *  request doesn't result in creation of duplicate commitments for at least 60

   *  For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the
   *  request times out. If you make the request again with the same request
   *  ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID
   *  was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents
   *  clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.
   *  The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is
