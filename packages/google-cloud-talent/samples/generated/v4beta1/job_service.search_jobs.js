   *  An expression specifies a histogram request against matching jobs.

   *  * `count(string_histogram_facet)`: Count the number of matching entities,
   *  for each distinct attribute value.
   *  * `count(numeric_histogram_facet, list of buckets)`: Count the number of
   *  matching entities within each bucket.
   *  Data types:
   *  * Histogram facet: facet names with format `[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]+`.
   *  * String: string like "any string with backslash escape for quote(\")."
   *  * Number: whole number and floating point number like 10, -1 and -0.01.
   *  * List: list of elements with comma(,) separator surrounded by square
   *  brackets, for example, 1, 2, 3 and "one", "two", "three".
   *  Built-in constants:
   *  * MIN (minimum number similar to java Double.MIN_VALUE)
   *  * MAX (maximum number similar to java Double.MAX_VALUE)
   *  Built-in functions:
   *  * bucket(start, end, label): bucket built-in function creates a bucket
