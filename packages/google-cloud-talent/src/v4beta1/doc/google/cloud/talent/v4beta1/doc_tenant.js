/**
 * A Tenant resource represents a tenant in the service. A tenant is a group or

 * profiles. Customer may create multiple tenants to provide data isolation for
 * different groups.
 *
 * @property {string} name
 *   Required during tenant update.
 *
 *   The resource name for a tenant. This is generated by the service when a
 *   tenant is created.
 *
 *   The format is "projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}", for example,
 *   "projects/api-test-project/tenants/foo".
 *
 * @property {string} externalId
 *   Required.
 *
 *   Client side tenant identifier, used to uniquely identify the tenant.
 *
 *   The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
 *
 * @property {number} usageType
 *   Optional.
 *
 *   Indicates whether data owned by this tenant may be used to provide product
 *   improvements across other tenants.
 *
 *   Defaults behavior is DataUsageType.ISOLATED if it's unset.
 *
 *   The number should be among the values of [DataUsageType]{@link google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.DataUsageType}
 *
 * @property {string[]} keywordSearchableProfileCustomAttributes
 *   Optional.
 *
 *   A list of keys of filterable Profile.custom_attributes, whose
 *   corresponding `string_values` are used in keyword searches. Profiles with
 *   `string_values` under these specified field keys are returned if any
 *   of the values match the search keyword. Custom field values with
 *   parenthesis, brackets and special symbols are not searchable as-is,
 *   and must be surrounded by quotes.
