/**
 * A resource that represents the profile for a job candidate (also referred to
 * as a "single-source profile"). A profile belongs to a Company, which is
 * the company/organization that owns the profile.
 *
 * @property {string} name
 *   Required during profile update.
 *
 *   Resource name assigned to a profile by the API.
 *
 *   The format is
 *   "projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/profiles/{profile_id}",
 *   for example, "projects/api-test-project/tenants/foo/profiles/bar".
 *
 * @property {string} externalId
 *   Optional.
 *
 *   Profile's id in client system if available.
 *
 *   The maximum number of bytes allowed is 100.
 *
 * @property {string} source
 *   Optional.
 *
 *   The source description indicating where the profile is acquired.
 *
 *   For example, if a candidate profile is acquired from a resume, the user can
 *   input "resume" here to indicate the source.
 *
 *   The maximum number of bytes allowed is 100.
 *
 * @property {string} uri

 *
 *   This field should be generated by the customer. If a value is not provided,
 *   a random UUI is assigned to this field of the profile.
 *
 *   This is used to link multiple profiles to the same candidate. For example,
 *   a client has a candidate with two profiles, where one was created recently
 *   and the other one was created 5 years ago. These two profiles may be very
 *   different. The clients can create the first profile and get a generated
 *   group_id, and assign it when the second profile is created,
 *   indicating these two profiles are referring to the same candidate.
 *
 * @property {Object} isHirable
 *   Optional.
 *
 *   Indicates the hirable status of the candidate.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [BoolValue]{@link google.protobuf.BoolValue}

 *   * Specify the start and end dates of the employment records.
 *   * List different employment types separately, no matter how minor the
 *   change is.
