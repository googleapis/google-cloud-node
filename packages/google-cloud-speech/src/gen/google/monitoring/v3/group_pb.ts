/**
 * The description of a dynamic collection of monitored resources. Each group
 * has a filter that is matched against monitored resources and their associated
 * metadata. If a group's filter matches an available monitored resource, then
 * that resource is a member of that group.  Groups can contain any number of
 * monitored resources, and each monitored resource can be a member of any
 * number of groups.
 *
 * Groups can be nested in parent-child hierarchies. The `parentName` field
 * identifies an optional parent for each group.  If a group has a parent, then
 * the only monitored resources available to be matched by the group's filter
 * are the resources contained in the parent group.  In other words, a group
 * contains the monitored resources that match its filter and the filters of all
 * the group's ancestors.  A group without a parent can contain any monitored
 * resource.
 *
 * For example, consider an infrastructure running a set of instances with two
 * user-defined tags: `"environment"` and `"role"`. A parent group has a filter,
 * `environment="production"`.  A child of that parent group has a filter,
 * `role="transcoder"`.  The parent group contains all instances in the
 * production environment, regardless of their roles.  The child group contains
 * instances that have the transcoder role *and* are in the production
 * environment.
 *
 * The monitored resources contained in a group can change at any moment,
 * depending on what resources exist and what filters are associated with the
 * group and its ancestors.
