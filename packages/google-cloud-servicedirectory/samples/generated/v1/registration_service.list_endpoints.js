  /**
   *  Optional. The filter to list result by.
   *  General filter string syntax:
   *  <field> <operator> <value> (<logical connector>)
   *  <field> can be "name", "address", "port" or "metadata.<key>" for map field.
   *  <operator> can be "<, >, <=, >=, !=, =, :". Of which ":" means HAS, and
   *  is roughly the same as "=".
   *  <value> must be the same data type as field.
   *  <logical connector> can be "AND, OR, NOT".
   *  Examples of valid filters:
   *  * "metadata.owner" returns Endpoints that have a label with the key "owner"
   *    this is the same as "metadata:owner".
   *  * "metadata.protocol=gRPC" returns Endpoints that have key/value
   *    "protocol=gRPC".
   *  * "address=192.108.1.105" returns Endpoints that have this address.
   *  * "port>8080" returns Endpoints that have port number larger than 8080.
   *  * "name>projects/my-project/locations/us-east/namespaces/my-namespace/services/my-service/endpoints/endpoint-c"
   *    returns Endpoints that have name that is alphabetically later than the
   *    string, so "endpoint-e" will be returned but "endpoint-a" will not be.
   *  * "metadata.owner!=sd AND metadata.foo=bar" returns Endpoints that have
   *    "owner" in label key but value is not "sd" AND have key/value foo=bar.
   *  * "doesnotexist.foo=bar" returns an empty list. Note that Endpoint doesn't
   *    have a field called "doesnotexist". Since the filter does not match any
   *    Endpoints, it returns no results.
