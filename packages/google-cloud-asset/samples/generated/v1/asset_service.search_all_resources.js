   *  * `displayName:Impor*` to find Google Cloud resources whose display name
   *    contains "Impor" as a prefix of any word in the field.
   *  * `location:us-west*` to find Google Cloud resources whose location
   *    contains both "us" and "west" as prefixes.
   *  * `labels:prod` to find Google Cloud resources whose labels contain "prod"
   *    as a key or value.
   *  * `labels.env:prod` to find Google Cloud resources that have a label "env"
   *    and its value is "prod".
   *  * `labels.env:*` to find Google Cloud resources that have a label "env".
   *  * `kmsKey:key` to find Google Cloud resources encrypted with a

   *    field is deprecated. Please use the `kmsKeys` field to retrieve Cloud KMS
   *    key information.
   *  * `kmsKeys:key` to find Google Cloud resources encrypted with
   *    customer-managed encryption keys whose name contains the word "key".
   *  * `relationships:instance-group-1` to find Google Cloud resources that have
   *    relationships with "instance-group-1" in the related resource name.
   *  * `relationships:INSTANCE_TO_INSTANCEGROUP` to find Compute Engine
   *    instances that have relationships of type "INSTANCE_TO_INSTANCEGROUP".
   *  * `relationships.INSTANCE_TO_INSTANCEGROUP:instance-group-1` to find
   *    Compute Engine instances that have relationships with "instance-group-1"

   *    "INSTANCE_TO_INSTANCEGROUP".
   *  * `state:ACTIVE` to find Google Cloud resources whose state contains
   *    "ACTIVE" as a word.
   *  * `NOT state:ACTIVE` to find Google Cloud resources whose state doesn't
   *    contain "ACTIVE" as a word.
   *  * `createTime<1609459200` to find Google Cloud resources that were created
   *    before "2021-01-01 00:00:00 UTC". 1609459200 is the epoch timestamp of
   *    "2021-01-01 00:00:00 UTC" in seconds.

   *  * `Important` to find Google Cloud resources that contain "Important" as a
   *    word in any of the searchable fields.
   *  * `Impor*` to find Google Cloud resources that contain "Impor" as a prefix
   *    of any word in any of the searchable fields.
   *  * `Important location:(us-west1 OR global)` to find Google Cloud
