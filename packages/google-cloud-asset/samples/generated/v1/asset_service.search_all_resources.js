   *  Examples:
   *  * `name:Important` to find Cloud resources whose name contains

   *  * `name=Important` to find the Cloud resource whose name is exactly
   *    "Important".
   *  * `displayName:Impor*` to find Cloud resources whose display name
   *    contains "Impor" as a prefix of any word in the field.
   *  * `location:us-west*` to find Cloud resources whose location contains both
   *    "us" and "west" as prefixes.
   *  * `labels:prod` to find Cloud resources whose labels contain "prod" as
   *    a key or value.
   *  * `labels.env:prod` to find Cloud resources that have a label "env"
   *    and its value is "prod".
   *  * `labels.env:*` to find Cloud resources that have a label "env".
   *  * `kmsKey:key` to find Cloud resources encrypted with a customer-managed
   *    encryption key whose name contains the word "key".
   *  * `state:ACTIVE` to find Cloud resources whose state contains "ACTIVE" as a
   *    word.
   *  * `NOT state:ACTIVE` to find Cloud resources whose state doesn't contain
   *    "ACTIVE" as a word.
   *  * `createTime<1609459200` to find Cloud resources that were created before
   *    "2021-01-01 00:00:00 UTC". 1609459200 is the epoch timestamp of
   *    "2021-01-01 00:00:00 UTC" in seconds.
   *  * `updateTime>1609459200` to find Cloud resources that were updated after

   *    "2021-01-01 00:00:00 UTC" in seconds.
   *  * `Important` to find Cloud resources that contain "Important" as a word
   *    in any of the searchable fields.
   *  * `Impor*` to find Cloud resources that contain "Impor" as a prefix of any
   *    word in any of the searchable fields.
   *  * `Important location:(us-west1 OR global)` to find Cloud
   *    resources that contain "Important" as a word in any of the searchable
