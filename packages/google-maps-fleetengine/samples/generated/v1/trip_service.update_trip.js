   *  When you specify `Trip.vehicle_waypoints`, the list must contain all
   *  the remaining waypoints of the vehicle's trips, with no extra waypoints.
   *  You must order these waypoints such that for a given trip, the pickup
   *  point is before intermediate destinations, and all intermediate
   *  destinations come before the drop-off point. An `EXCLUSIVE` trip's
   *  waypoints must not interleave with any other trips.
   *  The `trip_id`, `waypoint_type` and `location` fields are used, and all
   *  other TripWaypoint fields in `vehicle_waypoints` are ignored.
   *  To avoid a race condition for trips with multiple destinations, you
   *  should provide `Trip.intermediate_destinations_version` when updating
   *  the trip status to `ENROUTE_TO_INTERMEDIATE_DESTINATION`. The

   *  Fleet Engine's version. If it isn't, the request fails.
