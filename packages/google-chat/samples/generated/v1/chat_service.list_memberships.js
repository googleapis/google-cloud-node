   *  To filter by role, set `role` to `ROLE_MEMBER` or `ROLE_MANAGER`.
   *  To filter by type, set `member.type` to `HUMAN` or `BOT`. You can also
   *  filter for `member.type` using the `!=` operator.
   *  To filter by both role and type, use the `AND` operator. To filter by
   *  either role or type, use the `OR` operator.
   *  Either `member.type = "HUMAN"` or `member.type != "BOT"` is required
   *  when `use_admin_access` is set to true. Other member type filters will be
   *  rejected.
   *  For example, the following queries are valid:
   *  ```
   *  role = "ROLE_MANAGER" OR role = "ROLE_MEMBER"
   *  member.type = "HUMAN" AND role = "ROLE_MANAGER"
   *  member.type != "BOT"

   *  ```
   *  member.type = "HUMAN" AND member.type = "BOT"
   *  role = "ROLE_MANAGER" AND role = "ROLE_MEMBER"

   *  Invalid queries are rejected by the server with an `INVALID_ARGUMENT`
