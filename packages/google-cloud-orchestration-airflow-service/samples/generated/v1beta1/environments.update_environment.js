  /**
   *  Required. A comma-separated list of paths, relative to `Environment`, of
   *  fields to update.
   *  For example, to set the version of scikit-learn to install in the
   *  environment to 0.19.0 and to remove an existing installation of
   *  argparse, the `updateMask` parameter would include the following two
   *  `paths` values: "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.scikit-learn" and
   *  "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.argparse". The included patch
   *  environment would specify the scikit-learn version as follows:
   *      {
   *        "config":{
   *          "softwareConfig":{
   *            "pypiPackages":{
   *              "scikit-learn":"==0.19.0"
   *            }
   *          }
   *        }
   *      }
   *  Note that in the above example, any existing PyPI packages
   *  other than scikit-learn and argparse will be unaffected.
   *  Only one update type may be included in a single request's `updateMask`.
   *  For example, one cannot update both the PyPI packages and
   *  labels in the same request. However, it is possible to update multiple
   *  members of a map field simultaneously in the same request. For example,
   *  to set the labels "label1" and "label2" while clearing "label3" (assuming
   *  it already exists), one can
   *  provide the paths "labels.label1", "labels.label2", and "labels.label3"
   *  and populate the patch environment as follows:
   *      {
   *        "labels":{
   *          "label1":"new-label1-value"
   *          "label2":"new-label2-value"
   *        }
   *      }
   *  Note that in the above example, any existing labels that are not
   *  included in the `updateMask` will be unaffected.
   *  It is also possible to replace an entire map field by providing the
   *  map field's path in the `updateMask`. The new value of the field will
   *  be that which is provided in the patch environment. For example, to
   *  delete all pre-existing user-specified PyPI packages and
   *  install botocore at version 1.7.14, the `updateMask` would contain
   *  the path "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages", and
   *  the patch environment would be the following:
   *      {
   *        "config":{
   *          "softwareConfig":{
   *            "pypiPackages":{
   *              "botocore":"==1.7.14"
   *            }
   *          }
   *        }
   *      }
   *  **Note:** Only the following fields can be updated:
   *  * `config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages`
   *      * Replace all custom custom PyPI packages. If a replacement
   *        package map is not included in `environment`, all custom
   *        PyPI packages are cleared. It is an error to provide both
   *        this mask and a mask specifying an individual package.
   *  * `config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.`packagename
   *      * Update the custom PyPI package *packagename*,
   *        preserving other packages. To delete the package, include it in
   *        `updateMask`, and omit the mapping for it in
   *        `environment.config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages`. It is an error
   *        to provide both a mask of this form and the
   *        `config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages` mask.
   *  * `labels`
   *      * Replace all environment labels. If a replacement labels map is not
   *        included in `environment`, all labels are cleared. It is an error to
   *        provide both this mask and a mask specifying one or more individual
   *        labels.
   *  * `labels.`labelName
   *      * Set the label named *labelName*, while preserving other
   *        labels. To delete the label, include it in `updateMask` and omit its
   *        mapping in `environment.labels`. It is an error to provide both a
   *        mask of this form and the `labels` mask.
   *  * `config.nodeCount`
   *      * Horizontally scale the number of nodes in the environment. An integer
   *        greater than or equal to 3 must be provided in the `config.nodeCount`
   *        field. * `config.webServerNetworkAccessControl`
   *      * Replace the environment's current WebServerNetworkAccessControl.
   *  * `config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides`
   *      * Replace all Apache Airflow config overrides. If a replacement config
   *        overrides map is not included in `environment`, all config overrides
   *        are cleared.
   *        It is an error to provide both this mask and a mask specifying one or
   *        more individual config overrides.
   *  * `config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides.`section-name
   *      * Override the Apache Airflow config property *name* in the
   *        section named *section*, preserving other properties. To
   *        delete the property override, include it in `updateMask` and omit its
   *        mapping in
   *        `environment.config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides`.
   *        It is an error to provide both a mask of this form and the
   *        `config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides` mask.
   *  * `config.softwareConfig.envVariables`
   *      * Replace all environment variables. If a replacement environment
   *        variable map is not included in `environment`, all custom environment
   *        variables  are cleared.
   *        It is an error to provide both this mask and a mask specifying one or
   *        more individual environment variables.
   *  * `config.softwareConfig.imageVersion`
   *      * Upgrade the version of the environment in-place. Refer to
   *        `SoftwareConfig.image_version` for information on how to format the
   *        new image version. Additionally, the new image version cannot effect
   *        a version downgrade and must match the current image version's
   *        Composer major version and Airflow major and minor versions. Consult
   *        the Cloud Composer Version
   *        List (https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/concepts/versioning/composer-versions)
   *        for valid values.
   *  * `config.softwareConfig.schedulerCount`
   *      * Horizontally scale the number of schedulers in Airflow. A positive
   *        integer not greater than the number of nodes must be provided in the
   *        `config.softwareConfig.schedulerCount` field. * `config.databaseConfig.machineType`
   *      * Cloud SQL machine type used by Airflow database.
   *        It has to be one of: db-n1-standard-2, db-n1-standard-4,
   *        db-n1-standard-8 or db-n1-standard-16. * `config.webServerConfig.machineType`
   *      * Machine type on which Airflow web server is running.
   *        It has to be one of: composer-n1-webserver-2, composer-n1-webserver-4
   *        or composer-n1-webserver-8. * `config.maintenanceWindow`
   *      * Maintenance window during which Cloud Composer components may be
   *        under maintenance.
