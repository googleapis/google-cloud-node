  /**
   *  Optional. An expression that filters the list of Deployments.
   *  A filter expression consists of a field name, a comparison
   *  operator, and a value for filtering. The value must be a string. The
   *  comparison operator must be one of: `<`, `>` or
   *  `=`. Filters are not case sensitive.
   *  The following fields in the `Deployments` are eligible for filtering:
   *    * `display_name` - The display name of the Deployment. Allowed
   *    comparison operators: `=`.
   *    * `create_time` - The time at which the Deployment was created. The
   *    value should be in the (RFC3339)https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339 
   *    format. Allowed comparison operators: `>` and `<`.
   *    * `resource_uri` - A URI to the deployment resource. Allowed
   *    comparison operators: `=`.
   *    * `api_versions` - The API versions linked to this deployment. Allowed
   *    comparison operators: `:`.
   *    * `deployment_type.enum_values.values.id` - The allowed value id of the
   *    deployment_type attribute associated with the Deployment. Allowed
   *    comparison operators: `:`.
   *    * `deployment_type.enum_values.values.display_name` - The allowed value
   *    display name of the deployment_type attribute associated with the
   *    Deployment. Allowed comparison operators: `:`.
   *    * `slo.string_values.values` -The allowed string value of the slo
   *    attribute associated with the deployment. Allowed comparison
   *    operators: `:`.
   *    * `environment.enum_values.values.id` - The allowed value id of the
   *    environment attribute associated with the deployment. Allowed
   *    comparison operators: `:`.
   *    * `environment.enum_values.values.display_name` - The allowed value
   *    display name of the environment attribute associated with the deployment.
   *    Allowed comparison operators: `:`.
   *  Expressions are combined with either `AND` logic operator or `OR` logical
   *  operator but not both of them together i.e. only one of the `AND` or `OR`
   *  operator can be used throughout the filter string and both the operators
   *  cannot be used together. No other logical operators are supported. At most
   *  three filter fields are allowed in the filter string and if provided
   *  more than that then `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned by the API.
   *  Here are a few examples:
   *    * `environment.enum_values.values.id: staging-id` - The allowed value id
   *    of the environment attribute associated with the Deployment is
   *    _staging-id_.
   *    * `environment.enum_values.values.display_name: \"Staging Deployment\"` -
   *    The allowed value display name of the environment attribute associated
   *    with the Deployment is `Staging Deployment`.
   *    * `environment.enum_values.values.id: production-id AND create_time <
   *    \"2021-08-15T14:50:00Z\" AND create_time > \"2021-08-10T12:00:00Z\"` -
   *    The allowed value id of the environment attribute associated with the
   *    Deployment is _production-id_ and Deployment was created before
   *    _2021-08-15 14:50:00 UTC_ and after _2021-08-10 12:00:00 UTC_.
   *    * `environment.enum_values.values.id: production-id OR
   *    slo.string_values.values: \"99.99%\"`
   *    - The allowed value id of the environment attribute Deployment is
   *    _production-id_ or string value of the slo attribute is _99.99%_.
