  /**
   *  Optional. An expression that filters the list of Attributes.
   *  A filter expression consists of a field name, a comparison
   *  operator, and a value for filtering. The value must be a string or a
   *  boolean. The comparison operator must be one of: `<`, `>` or
   *  `=`. Filters are not case sensitive.
   *  The following fields in the `Attribute` are eligible for filtering:
   *    * `display_name` - The display name of the Attribute. Allowed
   *    comparison operators: `=`.
   *    * `definition_type` - The definition type of the attribute. Allowed
   *    comparison operators: `=`.
   *    * `scope` - The scope of the attribute. Allowed comparison operators:
   *    `=`.
   *    * `data_type` - The type of the data of the attribute. Allowed
   *    comparison operators: `=`.
   *    * `mandatory` - Denotes whether the attribute is mandatory or not.
   *    Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *    * `create_time` - The time at which the Attribute was created. The
   *    value should be in the (RFC3339)https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339 
   *    format. Allowed comparison operators: `>` and `<`.
   *  Expressions are combined with either `AND` logic operator or `OR` logical
   *  operator but not both of them together i.e. only one of the `AND` or `OR`
   *  operator can be used throughout the filter string and both the operators
   *  cannot be used together. No other logical operators are
   *  supported. At most three filter fields are allowed in the filter
   *  string and if provided more than that then `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is
   *  returned by the API.
   *  Here are a few examples:
   *    * `display_name = production` -  - The display name of the attribute is
   *    _production_.
   *    * `(display_name = production) AND (create_time <
   *    \"2021-08-15T14:50:00Z\") AND (create_time > \"2021-08-10T12:00:00Z\")` -
   *    The display name of the attribute is _production_ and the attribute was
   *    created before _2021-08-15 14:50:00 UTC_ and after _2021-08-10 12:00:00
   *    UTC_.
   *    * `display_name = production OR scope = api` -
   *    The attribute where the display name is _production_ or the scope is
   *    _api_.

   *  Optional. The maximum number of attribute resources to return. The service
   *  may return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 50 attributes
