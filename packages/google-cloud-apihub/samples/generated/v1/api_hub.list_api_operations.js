  /**
   *  Optional. An expression that filters the list of ApiOperations.
   *  A filter expression consists of a field name, a comparison
   *  operator, and a value for filtering. The value must be a string or a
   *  boolean. The comparison operator must be one of: `<`, `>` or
   *  `=`. Filters are not case sensitive.
   *  The following fields in the `ApiOperation` are eligible for filtering:
   *    * `name` - The ApiOperation resource name. Allowed comparison
   *    operators:
   *    `=`.
   *    * `details.http_operation.path.path` - The http operation's complete path
   *    relative to server endpoint. Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *    * `details.http_operation.method` - The http operation method type.
   *    Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *    * `details.deprecated` - Indicates if the ApiOperation is deprecated.
   *    Allowed values are True / False indicating the deprycation status of the
   *    ApiOperation. Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *    * `create_time` - The time at which the ApiOperation was created. The
   *    value should be in the (RFC3339)https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339 
   *    format. Allowed comparison operators: `>` and `<`.
   *  Expressions are combined with either `AND` logic operator or `OR` logical
   *  operator but not both of them together i.e. only one of the `AND` or `OR`
   *  operator can be used throughout the filter string and both the operators
   *  cannot be used together. No other logical operators are supported. At most
   *  three filter fields are allowed in the filter string and if provided
   *  more than that then `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned by the API.
   *  Here are a few examples:
   *    * `details.deprecated = True` -  The ApiOperation is deprecated.
   *    * `details.http_operation.method = GET AND create_time <
   *    \"2021-08-15T14:50:00Z\" AND create_time > \"2021-08-10T12:00:00Z\"` -
   *    The method of the http operation of the ApiOperation is _GET_ and the
   *    spec was created before _2021-08-15 14:50:00 UTC_ and after _2021-08-10
   *    12:00:00 UTC_.
   *    * `details.http_operation.method = GET OR details.http_operation.method =
   *    POST`. - The http operation of the method of ApiOperation is _GET_ or
   *    _POST_.

   *  Optional. The maximum number of operations to return. The service may
   *  return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 50 operations will be
