   *  A filter is a logical expression constraining the values of various fields
   *  in each session resource. Filters are case sensitive, and may contain
   *  multiple clauses combined with logical operators (AND, OR).
   *  Supported fields are `session_id`, `session_uuid`, `state`, `create_time`,
   *  and `labels`.
   *  Example: `state = ACTIVE and create_time < "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"`
   *  is a filter for sessions in an ACTIVE state that were created before
   *  2023-01-01. `state = ACTIVE and labels.environment=production` is a filter
   *  for sessions in an ACTIVE state that have a production environment label.
   *  See https://google.aip.dev/assets/misc/ebnf-filtering.txt for a detailed
   *  description of the filter syntax and a list of supported comparators.
