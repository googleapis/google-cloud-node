## Quickstart

### Before you begin

1.  [Select or create a Cloud Platform project][projects].
1.  [Enable billing for your project][billing].
1.  [Enable the Route Optimization API API][enable_api].
1.  [Set up authentication with a service account][auth] so you can access the
    API from your local workstation.

### Installing the client library

```bash
npm install @googlemaps/routeoptimization
```


### Using the client library

 * This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * It will require modifications to work.
 * It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.

 *  The model is constrained when the first solution is built.
 *  Any shipments not performed on a route are implicitly skipped in the first
 *  solution, but they may be performed in successive solutions.
 *  The solution must satisfy some basic validity assumptions:
 *    * for all routes, `vehicle_index` must be in range and not be duplicated.
 *    * for all visits, `shipment_index` and `visit_request_index` must be
 *      in range.
 *    * a shipment may only be referenced on one route.
 *    * the pickup of a pickup-delivery shipment must be performed before
 *      the delivery.
 *    * no more than one pickup alternative or delivery alternative of
 *      a shipment may be performed.
 *    * for all routes, times are increasing (i.e., `vehicle_start_time
 *      <= visits0.start_time <= visits1.start_time ...
 *      <= vehicle_end_time`).
 *    * a shipment may only be performed on a vehicle that is allowed. A
 *      vehicle is allowed if
 *      Shipment.allowed_vehicle_indices google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.Shipment.allowed_vehicle_indices
 *      is empty or its `vehicle_index` is included in
 *      Shipment.allowed_vehicle_indices google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.Shipment.allowed_vehicle_indices.
 *  If the injected solution is not feasible, a validation error is not
 *  necessarily returned and an error indicating infeasibility may be returned
 *  instead.

 *  requires that `populate_polylines` is true.
 *  The `route_polyline` fields of the passed-in routes may be inconsistent
 *  with route `transitions`.
 *  This field must not be used together with `injected_first_solution_routes`
 *  or `injected_solution_constraint`.
 *  `Shipment.ignore` and `Vehicle.ignore` have no effect on the behavior.
 *  Polylines are still populated between all visits in all non-empty routes
 *  regardless of whether the related shipments or vehicles are ignored.

 *      ShipmentRoute.vehicle_index google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.vehicle_index
 *      to new
 *      ShipmentRoute.vehicle_index google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.vehicle_index
 *      to update
 *      ConstraintRelaxation.vehicle_indices google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.InjectedSolutionConstraint.ConstraintRelaxation.vehicle_indices
 *      if non-empty, but the mapping must be unambiguous (i.e., multiple
 *      `ShipmentRoute`s must not share the same original `vehicle_index`).
 *    * uses
 *    ShipmentRoute.Visit.shipment_label google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.Visit.shipment_label
 *    instead of `shipment_index`
 *      to match visits in an injected solution with shipments in the request;
 *    * uses
 *    SkippedShipment.label google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.SkippedShipment.label
 *    instead of
 *    SkippedShipment.index google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.SkippedShipment.index
 *    to
 *      match skipped shipments in the injected solution with request
 *      shipments.
 *  This interpretation applies to the `injected_first_solution_routes`,
 *  `injected_solution_constraint`, and `refresh_details_routes` fields.
 *  It can be used when shipment or vehicle indices in the request have
 *  changed since the solution was created, perhaps because shipments or
 *  vehicles have been removed from or added to the request.
 *  If true, labels in the following categories must appear at most once in
 *  their category:
 *    * Vehicle.label google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.Vehicle.label  in the
 *    request;
 *    * Shipment.label google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.Shipment.label  in
 *    the request;
 *    * ShipmentRoute.vehicle_label google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.vehicle_label  in the injected solution;
 *    * SkippedShipment.label google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.SkippedShipment.label  and ShipmentRoute.Visit.shipment_label google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.Visit.shipment_label  in
 *      the injected solution (except pickup/delivery visit pairs, whose
 *      `shipment_label` must appear twice).
 *  If a `vehicle_label` in the injected solution does not correspond to a
 *  request vehicle, the corresponding route is removed from the solution
 *  along with its visits. If a `shipment_label` in the injected solution does
 *  not correspond to a request shipment, the corresponding visit is removed
 *  from the solution. If a
 *  SkippedShipment.label google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.SkippedShipment.label
 *  in the injected solution does not correspond to a request shipment, the
 *  `SkippedShipment` is removed from the solution.
 *  Removing route visits or entire routes from an injected solution may
 *  have an effect on the implied constraints, which may lead to change in
 *  solution, validation errors, or infeasibility.
 *  NOTE: The caller must ensure that each
 *  Vehicle.label google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.Vehicle.label  (resp.
 *  Shipment.label google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.Shipment.label) uniquely
 *  identifies a vehicle (resp. shipment) entity used across the two relevant
 *  requests: the past request that produced the `OptimizeToursResponse` used
 *  in the injected solution and the current request that includes the injected
 *  solution. The uniqueness checks described above are not enough to guarantee
 *  this requirement.

The [Route Optimization API Node.js Client API Reference][client-docs] documentation
also contains samples.

## Supported Node.js Versions

Our client libraries follow the [Node.js release schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule).
Libraries are compatible with all current _active_ and _maintenance_ versions of
Node.js.
If you are using an end-of-life version of Node.js, we recommend that you update
as soon as possible to an actively supported LTS version.

Google's client libraries support legacy versions of Node.js runtimes on a
best-efforts basis with the following warnings:

* Legacy versions are not tested in continuous integration.
* Some security patches and features cannot be backported.
* Dependencies cannot be kept up-to-date.

Client libraries targeting some end-of-life versions of Node.js are available, and
can be installed through npm [dist-tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag).
The dist-tags follow the naming convention `legacy-(version)`.
For example, `npm install @googlemaps/routeoptimization@legacy-8` installs client libraries
for versions compatible with Node.js 8.

## Versioning

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).







This library is considered to be in **preview**. This means it is still a
work-in-progress and under active development. Any release is subject to
backwards-incompatible changes at any time.
