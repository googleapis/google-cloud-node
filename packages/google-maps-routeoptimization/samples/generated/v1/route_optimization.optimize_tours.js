   *  The model is constrained when the first solution is built.
   *  Any shipments not performed on a route are implicitly skipped in the first

   *  The solution must satisfy some basic validity assumptions:
   *    * for all routes, `vehicle_index` must be in range and not be duplicated.
   *    * for all visits, `shipment_index` and `visit_request_index` must be

   *    * no more than one pickup alternative or delivery alternative of
   *      a shipment may be performed.

   *      shipments.
   *  This interpretation applies to the `injected_first_solution_routes`,
   *  `injected_solution_constraint`, and `refresh_details_routes` fields.
   *  It can be used when shipment or vehicle indices in the request have
   *  changed since the solution was created, perhaps because shipments or

   *    * SkippedShipment.label google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.SkippedShipment.label  and ShipmentRoute.Visit.shipment_label google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.Visit.shipment_label  in
   *      the injected solution (except pickup/delivery visit pairs, whose
   *      `shipment_label` must appear twice).
   *  If a `vehicle_label` in the injected solution does not correspond to a
   *  request vehicle, the corresponding route is removed from the solution
   *  along with its visits. If a `shipment_label` in the injected solution does
   *  not correspond to a request shipment, the corresponding visit is removed
   *  from the solution. If a
   *  SkippedShipment.label google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.SkippedShipment.label 
   *  in the injected solution does not correspond to a request shipment, the
   *  `SkippedShipment` is removed from the solution.
   *  Removing route visits or entire routes from an injected solution may
   *  have an effect on the implied constraints, which may lead to change in
   *  solution, validation errors, or infeasibility.

   *  Shipment.label google.maps.routeoptimization.v1.Shipment.label) uniquely

   *  solution. The uniqueness checks described above are not enough to guarantee
