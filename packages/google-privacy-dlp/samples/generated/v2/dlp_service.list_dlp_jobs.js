   *  Allows filtering.
   *  Supported syntax:
   *  * Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions.
   *  * Restrictions can be combined by `AND` or `OR` logical operators. A
   *  sequence of restrictions implicitly uses `AND`.
   *  * A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`.
   *  * Supported fields/values for inspect jobs:
   *      - `state` - PENDING|RUNNING|CANCELED|FINISHED|FAILED
   *      - `inspected_storage` - DATASTORE|CLOUD_STORAGE|BIGQUERY
   *      - `trigger_name` - The name of the trigger that created the job.
   *      - 'end_time` - Corresponds to the time the job finished.
   *      - 'start_time` - Corresponds to the time the job finished.
   *  * Supported fields for risk analysis jobs:
   *      - `state` - RUNNING|CANCELED|FINISHED|FAILED
   *      - 'end_time` - Corresponds to the time the job finished.
   *      - 'start_time` - Corresponds to the time the job finished.
   *  * The operator must be `=` or `!=`.
   *  Examples:
   *  * inspected_storage = cloud_storage AND state = done
   *  * inspected_storage = cloud_storage OR inspected_storage = bigquery
   *  * inspected_storage = cloud_storage AND (state = done OR state = canceled)
   *  * end_time > \"2017-12-12T00:00:00+00:00\"
   *  The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters.
