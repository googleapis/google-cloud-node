   *  Supported fields are:
   *  - `project_id`: The Google Cloud project ID.

   *  - `data_risk_level`: How much risk is associated with this data.
   *  - `profile_last_generated`: When the profile was last updated in epoch
   *  seconds.
   *  - `last_modified`: The last time the resource was modified.
   *  - `resource_visibility`: Visibility restriction for this resource.

   *  * Restrictions can be combined by `AND` or `OR` logical operators. A
   *  sequence of restrictions implicitly uses `AND`.
   *  * A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`.
   *  * Supported fields/values:
   *      - `project_id` - The Google Cloud project ID.
   *      - `account_id` - The AWS account ID.
   *      - `file_store_path` - The path like "gs://bucket".
   *      - `data_source_type` - The profile's data source type, like
   *      "google/storage/bucket".
   *      - `data_storage_location` - The location where the file store's data is
   *      stored, like "us-central1".
   *      - `sensitivity_level` - HIGH|MODERATE|LOW
   *      - `data_risk_level` - HIGH|MODERATE|LOW
   *      - `resource_visibility`: PUBLIC|RESTRICTED
   *      - `status_code` - an RPC status code as defined in
   *      https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/code.proto
   *  * The operator must be `=` or `!=`.
   *  Examples:
   *  * `project_id = 12345 AND status_code = 1`
   *  * `project_id = 12345 AND sensitivity_level = HIGH`
   *  * `project_id = 12345 AND resource_visibility = PUBLIC`
   *  * `file_store_path = "gs://mybucket"`
   *  The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters.
