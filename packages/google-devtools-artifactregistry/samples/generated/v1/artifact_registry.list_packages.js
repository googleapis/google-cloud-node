   *  Optional. An expression for filtering the results of the request. Filter
   *  rules are case insensitive. The fields eligible for filtering are:
   *    * `name`
   *    * `annotations`
   *  Examples of using a filter:
   *   To filter the results of your request to packages with the name
   *   `my-package` in project `my-project` in the `us-central` region, in
   *   repository `my-repo`, append the following filter expression to your
   *   request:
   *    * `name="projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/repositories/my-repo/packages/my-package"`
   *   You can also use wildcards to match any number of characters before or
   *   after the value:
   *    * `name="projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/repositories/my-repo/packages/my-*"`
   *    * `name="projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/repositories/my-repo/packages/*package"`
   *    * `name="projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/repositories/my-repo/packages/*pack*"`
   *   To filter the results of your request to packages with the annotation
   *   key-value pair `external_link`: `external_link_value`, append the
   *   following filter expression to your request":
   *    * `"annotations.external_link:external_link_value"`
   *   To filter the results just for a specific annotation key `external_link`,
   *   append the following filter expression to your request:
   *    * `"annotations.external_link"`
   *   If the annotation key or value contains special characters, you can escape
   *   them by surrounding the value with backticks. For example, to filter the
   *   results of your request to packages with the annotation key-value pair
   *   `external.link`:`https://example.com/my-package`, append the following
   *   filter expression to your request:
   *    * `` "annotations.`external.link`:`https://example.com/my-package`" ``
   *   You can also filter with annotations with a wildcard to
   *   match any number of characters before or after the value:
   *    * `` "annotations.*_link:`*example.com*`" ``
