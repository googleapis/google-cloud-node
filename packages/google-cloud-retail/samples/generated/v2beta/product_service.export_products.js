   *  A filtering expression to specify restrictions on returned events.
   *  The expression is a sequence of terms. Each term applies a restriction to
   *  the returned products. Use this expression to restrict results to a
   *  specific time range, tag, or stock state or to filter products by product
   *  type.
   *  For example, `lastModifiedTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z"
   *  lastModifiedTime<"2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" productType=primary`
   *    We expect only four types of fields:
   *     * `lastModifiedTime`: This can be specified twice, once with a
   *       less than operator and once with a greater than operator. The
   *       `lastModifiedTime` restriction should result in one, contiguous,
   *       valid, last-modified, time range.
   *     * `productType`: Supported values are `primary` and `variant`. The
   *     Boolean operators `OR` and `NOT` are supported if the expression is
   *     enclosed in parentheses and must be separated from the
   *       `productType` values by a space.
   *     * `availability`: Supported values are `IN_STOCK`, `OUT_OF_STOCK`,
   *     `PREORDER`, and `BACKORDER`. Boolean operators `OR` and `NOT` are
   *     supported if the expression is enclosed in parentheses and must be
   *     separated from the `availability` values by a space.
   *     * `Tag expressions`: Restricts output to products that match all of the
   *       specified tags. Boolean operators `OR` and `NOT` are supported if the
   *       expression is enclosed in parentheses and the operators are separated
   *       from the tag values by a space. Also supported is '`-"tagA"`', which
   *       is equivalent to '`NOT "tagA"`'. Tag values must be double-quoted,
   *       UTF-8 encoded strings and have a size limit of 1,000 characters.
   *    Some examples of valid filters expressions:
   *    * Example 1: `lastModifiedTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z"
   *              lastModifiedTime < "2012-04-23T18:30:43.511Z"`
   *    * Example 2: `lastModifiedTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z"
   *              productType = "variant"`
   *    * Example 3: `tag=("Red" OR "Blue") tag="New-Arrival"
   *              tag=(NOT "promotional")
   *              productType = "primary" lastModifiedTime <
   *              "2018-04-23T18:30:43.511Z"`
   *    * Example 4: `lastModifiedTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z"`
   *    * Example 5: `availability = (IN_STOCK OR BACKORDER)`
