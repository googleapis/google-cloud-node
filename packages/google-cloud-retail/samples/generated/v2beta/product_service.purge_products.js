   *  Required. The filter string to specify the products to be deleted with a
   *  length limit of 5,000 characters.
   *  Empty string filter is not allowed. "*" implies delete all items in a
   *  branch.
   *  The eligible fields for filtering are:
   *  * `availability`: Double quoted
   *  Product.availability google.cloud.retail.v2beta.Product.availability 
   *  string.
   *  * `create_time` : in ISO 8601 "zulu" format.
   *  Supported syntax:
   *  * Comparators (">", "<", ">=", "<=", "=").
   *    Examples:
   *    * create_time <= "2015-02-13T17:05:46Z"
   *    * availability = "IN_STOCK"
   *  * Conjunctions ("AND")
   *    Examples:
   *    * create_time <= "2015-02-13T17:05:46Z" AND availability = "PREORDER"
   *  * Disjunctions ("OR")
   *    Examples:
   *    * create_time <= "2015-02-13T17:05:46Z" OR availability = "IN_STOCK"
   *  * Can support nested queries.
   *    Examples:
   *    * (create_time <= "2015-02-13T17:05:46Z" AND availability = "PREORDER")
   *    OR (create_time >= "2015-02-14T13:03:32Z" AND availability = "IN_STOCK")
   *  * Filter Limits:
   *    * Filter should not contain more than 6 conditions.
   *    * Max nesting depth should not exceed 2 levels.
   *  Examples queries:
   *  * Delete back order products created before a timestamp.
   *    create_time <= "2015-02-13T17:05:46Z" OR availability = "BACKORDER"
