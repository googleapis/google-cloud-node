This method provides admission control for services that are integrated with [Service Infrastructure](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure). It checks whether an operation should be allowed based on the service configuration and relevant policies. It must be called before the operation is executed. For more information, see [Admission Control](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/admission-control). NOTE: The admission control has an expected policy propagation delay of 60s. The caller **must** not depend on the most recent policy changes. NOTE: The admission control has a hard limit of 1 referenced resources per call. If an operation refers to more than 1 resources, the caller must call the Check method multiple times. This method requires the `servicemanagement.services.check` permission on the specified service.
