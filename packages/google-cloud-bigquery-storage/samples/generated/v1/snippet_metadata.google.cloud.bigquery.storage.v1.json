            "description": " Creates a new read session. A read session divides the contents of a BigQuery table into one or more streams, which can then be used to read data from the table. The read session also specifies properties of the data to be read, such as a list of columns or a push-down filter describing the rows to be returned. A particular row can be read by at most one stream. When the caller has reached the end of each stream in the session, then all the data in the table has been read. Data is assigned to each stream such that roughly the same number of rows can be read from each stream. Because the server-side unit for assigning data is collections of rows, the API does not guarantee that each stream will return the same number or rows. Additionally, the limits are enforced based on the number of pre-filtered rows, so some filters can lead to lopsided assignments. Read sessions automatically expire 6 hours after they are created and do not require manual clean-up by the caller.",

The server returns `OUT_OF_RANGE` in `AppendRowsResponse` if an attempt is made to append to an offset beyond the current end of the stream or `ALREADY_EXISTS` if user provides an `offset` that has already been written to. User can retry with adjusted offset within the same RPC connection. If `offset` is not specified, append happens at the end of the stream. The response contains an optional offset at which the append happened.  No offset information will be returned for appends to a default stream. Responses are received in the same order in which requests are sent. There will be one response for each successful inserted request.  Responses may optionally embed error information if the originating AppendRequest was not successfully processed. The specifics of when successfully appended data is made visible to the table are governed by the type of stream: * For COMMITTED streams (which includes the default stream), data is visible immediately upon successful append. * For BUFFERED streams, data is made visible via a subsequent `FlushRows` rpc which advances a cursor to a newer offset in the stream. * For PENDING streams, data is not made visible until the stream itself is finalized (via the `FinalizeWriteStream` rpc), and the stream is explicitly committed via the `BatchCommitWriteStreams` rpc. Note: For users coding against the gRPC api directly, it may be necessary to supply the x-goog-request-params system parameter with `write_stream=<full_write_stream_name>`.
