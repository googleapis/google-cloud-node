            "description": " Creates a new read session. A read session divides the contents of a BigQuery table into one or more streams, which can then be used to read data from the table. The read session also specifies properties of the data to be read, such as a list of columns or a push-down filter describing the rows to be returned. A particular row can be read by at most one stream. When the caller has reached the end of each stream in the session, then all the data in the table has been read. Data is assigned to each stream such that roughly the same number of rows can be read from each stream. Because the server-side unit for assigning data is collections of rows, the API does not guarantee that each stream will return the same number or rows. Additionally, the limits are enforced based on the number of pre-filtered rows, so some filters can lead to lopsided assignments. Read sessions automatically expire 6 hours after they are created and do not require manual clean-up by the caller.",
