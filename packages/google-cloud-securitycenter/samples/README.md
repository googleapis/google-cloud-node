[Cloud Security Command Center](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/) helps
security teams gather data, identify threats, and act on them before they result in business
damage or loss. It offers deep insight into application and data risk so that you can quickly
mitigate threats to your cloud resources and evaluate overall health. With Cloud Security
Command Center, you can view and monitor an inventory of your cloud assets, scan storage
systems for sensitive data, detect common web vulnerabilities, and review access rights
to your critical resources, all from a single, centralized dashboard.
