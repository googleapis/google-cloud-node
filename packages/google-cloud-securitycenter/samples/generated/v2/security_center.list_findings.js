   *  Expression that defines the filter to apply across findings.
   *  The expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical
   *  operators `AND` and `OR`.
   *  Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`.
   *  Restrictions have the form `<field> <operator> <value>` and may have a `-`
   *  character in front of them to indicate negation. Examples include:
   *   * name
   *   * security_marks.marks.marka
   *  The supported operators are:
   *  * `=` for all value types.
   *  * `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for integer values.
   *  * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.
   *  The supported value types are:
   *  * string literals in quotes.
   *  * integer literals without quotes.
   *  * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes.
   *  The following field and operator combinations are supported:
   *  * name: `=`
   *  * parent: `=`, `:`
   *  * resource_name: `=`, `:`
   *  * state: `=`, `:`
   *  * category: `=`, `:`
   *  * external_uri: `=`, `:`
   *  * event_time: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
   *    Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string.
   *    Examples:
   *      `event_time = "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"`
   *      `event_time = 1560208038000`
   *  * severity: `=`, `:`
   *  * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:`
   *  * resource:
   *    * resource.name: `=`, `:`
   *    * resource.parent_name: `=`, `:`
   *    * resource.parent_display_name: `=`, `:`
